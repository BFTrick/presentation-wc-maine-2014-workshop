^ I'm actually going to start with the solutions. That's because as we go through this presentation I'm going to refer back to these solutions.

---

# [fit] Marketplaces

^ So who here wants to make money while they sleep? Who wants to wake up to an inbox full of purchase receipts?

^ Perhaps one of the easiest ways to get started selling anything online is to do so through a marketplace.

---

# [fit] Offsite Payments

^ Okay so offsite payments is the 2nd easiest way to get started selling something online. The big difference it that you *need* a website. The basic idea is that you talk all about a product on your site and then you link to a separate site that takes the payment.

---

# Offsite Payments

* PayPal

^ Most of us have seen these online somewhere. Maybe you're buying an e-book, maybe a plugin developer is asking for a donation, or some other small site.

^ This is by far the simplest solution to getting money online but that doesn't mean it's the worst. I've used PayPal buttons to sell giftcards to a restaurant online, I've set up PayPal buttons for an entire specialty book store.

# Offsite Payments

* PayPal

# [fit] Hosted E-Commerce

^ If you only want an online store and you don't want any blogging functionality, or you don't want to customize it you could certainly use a web app that only does e-commerce

^ Hosted solutions are really easy to set up but you trade control

# [fit] What are you Selling?

^ It's really important to figure out exactly what you're selling.

---

## What Are the *Deliverables*?

---

# *No deliverables*

## ex. hosting fee

---

# *Electronic goods*

## ex. PDFs, images, movies, etc.

---

# *Physical goods*

## ex. shoes, t-shirts, furniture, etc.

^ Of course with physical goods you need to also worry about shipping which we'll get to later.
